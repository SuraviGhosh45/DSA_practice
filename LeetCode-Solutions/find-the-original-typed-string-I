LeetCode Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-original-typed-string-i/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-07-01

Example:
Input: 
word = "abbcccc"
Output: 5

Explanation:
The possible original strings are:
"abbcccc"
"abbccc"
"abbcc"
"abbc"
"abcccc"
So, the answer is 5.


Solution:
1.Take a variable count with a value of 1 (because every alphabet in the word string occurs at least once).
2.Iterate through the string and check if the character occurs repeatedly or not.
3. If yes, increase count by 1.
4.return count.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Code
class Solution(object):
    def possibleStringCount(self, word):
        count=1 
        
        for i in range(1,len(word)):
            if word[i-1]==word[i]:
                count+=1
        return count
