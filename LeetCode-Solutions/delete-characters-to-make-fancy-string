Problem Link --> https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-characters-to-make-fancy-string/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-07-21

Example:
Input: s = "aaabaaaa"
Output: "aabaa"

Explanation:
Remove an 'a' from the first group of 'a's to create "aabaaaa".
Remove two 'a's from the second group of 'a's to create "aabaa".
No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "aabaa".

Solution:
Approach: Greedy + One-Pass Iteration
1.Initialize variables:
 -prev to track the previous character.
 -count to track how many times prev has appeared consecutively.
 -ans to build the resulting string.
2.Loop through the string from the second character:
 -If the current character is same as prev, increment count.
 -If it's different, reset prev and count.
 -Only append to ans if count < 3.
3.Return the final string.

Time Complexity:O(N)
Space Complexity:O(1)

Code:
class Solution(object):
    def makeFancyString(self, s):
        prev=s[0]
        count=1
        ans=prev
        for i in range(1,len(s)):
            if s[i]==prev:
                count+=1
            else:
                prev=s[i]
                count=1
            if count<3:
                ans=ans+s[i]
        return ans
