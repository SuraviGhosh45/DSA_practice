Example:
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
Explanation : reverse each word in a string 

Solution:
 1. Splitting the String and store in lst 
    - This splits the string s into words by using split(), ignoring extra spaces.
    - Example: " hello world " → ["hello", "world"].
2. Reversing the Word Order
  - Iterate from the last word to the first using a reverse loop:
     - After appending each word, add a space " " if it’s not the first word.
3. Joining the Result by "".join(reverse)  to concatenates words and spaces into the final reversed string.

Time Complexity: O(n) (splitting + traversing + joining).
Space Complexity: O(n) (to store the reversed words).

Code:
class Solution(object):
    def reverseWords(self, s):
       
        lst= s.split()
        reverse=[]
        for i in range(len(lst)-1,-1,-1):
            reverse.append(lst[i])
            if i !=0:
                reverse.append(" ")
        return "".join(reverse)
