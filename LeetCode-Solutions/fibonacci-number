Example:
Input: n = 4

Output: 3

Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.

Solution 1: 
This implementation uses a Recursive Fibonacci to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.
The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
  - F(0) = 0
  - F(1) = 1
  - F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1
The function calls itself recursively to compute F(n-1) and F(n-2), then returns their sum.
Note --> [Using `@staticmethod` improves clarity, signaling that fib is a utility function.]

Time Complexity:O(2^n)
Space Complexity:O(n)

Code:
class Solution(object):
    @staticmethod
    def fib(n):
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        elif n == 1:
            return 1
        return Solution.fib(n - 1) + Solution.fib(n - 2)
Solution 2:
Another Way to implement this series is Iterative Fibonacci 
Instead of recursion, we use a loop to **build up the result** from the base cases.
We initialize:
  - `t0 = 0` (F(0))
  - `t1 = 1` (F(1))
- Then, we loop from `1` to `n-1` and compute the current Fibonacci number as the sum of the previous two.

Time Complexity:O(n)
Space Complexity:O(1)

Code:
class Solution(object):
    @staticmethod
    def fib(n):
        if n == 0 or n == 1:
            return n
        t0 = 0
        t1 = 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            temp = t0 + t1
            t0 = t1
            t1 = temp
        return temp
