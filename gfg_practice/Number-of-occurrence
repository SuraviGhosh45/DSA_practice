Example:
arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3], target = 2
Output: 4

Explanation: 
target = 2 occurs 4 times in the given array so the output is 4.

Solution:
This is a simple linear search approach using a loop to count how many times the target occurs in the array.

1.Initialize a count variable to 0.
2.Loop through each element of the array:
 -If the element is equal to target, increment count by 1.
3.Return the count

Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity:O(1)

Code:
class Solution:
    def countFreq(self, arr, target):
        
        count=0
        
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            if arr[i]==target:
                count+=1
                
        return count
