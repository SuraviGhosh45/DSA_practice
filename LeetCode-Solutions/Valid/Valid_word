Example:
Input: word = "234Adas"
Output: true

Explanation:
It contains a minimum of 3 characters.
It contains  digits (0-9) and English letters (uppercase and lowercase).
It includes at least one vowel.
It includes at least one consonant.

Solution:
1.If the word has fewer than 3 characters, it is immediately invalid.
2.Initialize two flags: vowel = False and consonant = False.
3.Loop through each character in the word:
  -If the character is a letter , Convert it to lowercase.
  -If it's a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), set vowel = True.
  -If it's not a vowel (i.e., a consonant), set consonant = True.
  -If the character is not a letter or digit (e.g., special characters), the word is invalid.
4.Return True only if both vowel and consonant flags are True.

Time Complexity:O(n)
Space Complexity:O(1)

Code:
class Solution(object):
    def isValid(self, word):

        VOWELS = "aeiou"

        if len(word) < 3:
            return False
        vowel = consonant = False
        for x in word:
            if x.isalpha():
                if x.lower() in VOWELS:
                    vowel = True
                else:
                    consonant = True
            elif not x.isdigit():
                return False
        return vowel and consonant
