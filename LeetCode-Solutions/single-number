1.Use a dictionary to count the frequency of each number.
2.Iterate through the dictionary to find the number with frequency equal to 1.
3.Return that number.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

Code: 
class Solution(object):
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        dct={}
        for i in nums:
            dct[i]=dct.get(i,0)+1
        for i in dct:
            if dct[i]==1:
                return i
