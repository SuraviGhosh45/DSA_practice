Example:
Input: arr = [1,2,2,3,3,3]
Output: 3

Explanation: 
here 1 occur for 1 time , 2 occur for 2 times and 3 for 3 times.
Hence 1, 2 and 3 are all lucky numbers, return the largest of them.

Solution:
1.Initialize a frequency table using a dictionary to count occurrences of each number in the array.
2.Iterate through the array and update the count for each number.
3.Check for lucky integers by iterating over the frequency table:
A number is lucky if its value equals its frequency.
4.Track the maximum lucky integer found so far using a variable (lucky), initialized to -1.
5.Return the result,If no lucky integer is found, return -1.

Time Complexity:O(n)
Space Complexity:O(n)

Code:
class Solution(object):
    def findLucky(self, arr):
        table={}
        lucky=-1
        for i in arr:
            table[i]=table.get(i,0)+1
        
        for i in table:
            if i==table[i]:
                lucky=max(lucky,table[i])
        return lucky
