Example 1:

Input: k = 5
Output: "b"

Explanation:
Initially, word = "a". We need to do the operation three times:
Generated string is "b", word becomes "ab".
Generated string is "bc", word becomes "abbc".
Generated string is "bccd", word becomes "abbcbccd".

Solution:
to solve this we use recursion here,
1.for fixing the base case that is if k==1 return 'a'.
2.then initialize leng =1 to check whether the 
3.
4.
