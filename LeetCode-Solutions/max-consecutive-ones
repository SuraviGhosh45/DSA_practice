Example :
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3

Explanation: 
The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. 
The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.

Solution:
1.Initialize two counters: count for current consecutive 1s and max_count for the maximum found.
2.Iterate through the array:
 -If the current element is 1, increment count and update max_count.
 -If it's 0, reset count to 0.
3.After the loop, return max_count.

Time Complexity: O(n) 
Space Complexity: O(1)

Code:
class Solution(object):
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums):
        max_count=count=0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i]==1:
                count+=1
                max_count=max(max_count,count)
            else:
                count=0
        return max_count
