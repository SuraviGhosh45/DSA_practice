Example:
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8

Explanation:
n = 9 since there are 9 numbers,
so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 
8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Solution: 
1.Start with val = 0.
2.Iterate from 0 to len(nums) (inclusive):
 -If val is not in nums, return it as the smallest missing number.
3.Otherwise, increment val by 1.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Code:
val=0
  for i in range(len(nums)+1):
      if val not in nums:
        return val
      val+=1
